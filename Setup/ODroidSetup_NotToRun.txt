# Bash: THIS IS NOT A EXECUTABLE SCRIPT. THIS IS AN INSTRUCTABLE.

# UbuntuMATE OS is used here. 
# UbuntuMATE is probably the only relevant distro of Ubuntu that provides GUI on ARM platform, 
# which also has its 16.04 distribution available.

# After First Login, Connect to Wi-fi

# 1. Basics

# Set Time: Time is very important to prevent network issues. 
# Initially just set the correct date. Time can be anything
sudo date MMDDhhmmYYYY.ss 
# Eg. sudo date 102612002019.00
# This has to be repeated every time the system is restarted.

# Set "Apt" Proxy When Needed
sudo echo 'Acquire::http::Proxy "http://172.16.2.30:8080/";' > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/proxy.conf
sudo echo 'Acquire::https::Proxy "https://172.16.2.30:8080/";' > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/proxy.conf
sudo echo 'Acquire::ftp::Proxy "ftp://172.16.2.30:8080/";' > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/proxy.conf

sudo echo 'Acquire::http::Proxy "http://172.16.2.30:8080/";' > /etc/apt/apt.conf
sudo echo 'Acquire::https::Proxy "https://172.16.2.30:8080/";' > /etc/apt/apt.conf
sudo echo 'Acquire::ftp::Proxy "ftp://172.16.2.30:8080/";' > /etc/apt/apt.conf

# Proxy for other command line tools
sudo echo 'export http_proxy="http://172.16.2.30:8080/"' > ~/.bashrc 
sudo echo 'export http_proxy="http://172.16.2.30:8080/"' > ~/.bashrc 
sudo echo 'export http_proxy="http://172.16.2.30:8080/"' > ~/.bashrc 
sudo echo 'export no_proxy="localhost,127.0.0.0,127.0.1.1,10.*.*.*, 192.168.*.*"' > ~/.bashrc 

#Enable SSH
sudo apt-get install upgrade
sudo apt-get install upgrade
# On a fresh image of Ubuntu MATE, SSH doesn't work properly, apparently because it is openSSH. 
sudo apt-get install ssh
sudo systemctl enable ssh

# Enable wireless connection without Local user Login to allow direct SSH
GUI> Go To Edit Connections > Edit the Current Wi-Fi > Allow all users to connect to this network

# Alternatively, enable auto-login for user 'odroid': Edit the lightdm.conf (UbuntuMate only) and make changes as shown:
sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
Add/Change the line as follows:
autologin-user=odroid

# Change host name
# Having different names is important to identify odroids when multiple of them are SSHed into.
sudo nano /etc/hostname
sudo nano /etc/hosts
